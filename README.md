T'was the afternoon of January 22, the year of our lord 2024, when Mael Huarcaya '26 had an epiphany
He was tired of his robotics team being humiliated every single competition
Auton wasn't working
Mechanisms weren't working
Driving wasn't working
He was tired of all the robot's problems being a "Mael" diff
He was tired of looking at the swerve code and having no idea what he was looking at 
And so, 
One day, 
He had finally had enough 
He was going to make his own swerve code, 
No matter how hard, 
How arduous, 
How tortuous, 
How mindboggling, 
How rage-inducing, 
How migraine-giving
It would be
And so, 
FTC-23737 was born
(thank you Aiden)
